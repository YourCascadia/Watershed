Watershed
 is the name for the front-end of the first version of the YourCascadia platform!

Originally coded in html, js, & css, it was later switched over to an Angular project, where it is currently in its very early stages of development (under the "my-app" folder).

Further development is currently on hold until the community decides on the best back-end platform to use.
